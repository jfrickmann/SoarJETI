# SoarJETI sailplane apps for JETI radios
You can find the Lua source code for all of the apps under [Src](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Src). Radios with plenty of memory can run these source files as is, but I have also added compiled files under [Apps](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Apps), and these will consume less memory and start up faster, because they do not have to be compiled from source by the radio. Finally, for radios with small memories, I have added compiled files with the debug info stripped out in [Stripped](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Stripped). I only have a DS-12 myself, and therefore I do not know if my apps are able to run on radios with smaller memories.
In addition to the score keeping apps for sailplanes, I have also included a couple of utility apps that I find useful.

To install the apps on your transmitter, connect the transmitter to your computer, and copy over the files from *either* [Apps](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Apps), [Src](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Src) *or* [Stripped](https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI/tree/main/Stripped) in this repository to the **Apps** folder on your transmitter's SD-card. Then, navigate to **Applications**, **User Applications** on your radio's menus, and install the apps for the currently loaded model. Notice that the apps will be added to the radio's menus as described below for each app.
