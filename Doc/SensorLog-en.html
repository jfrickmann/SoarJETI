 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>This app allows you to save sensor values to a table. You assign a switch to trigger when a value should be saved. 
 As an example, a discuss launch pilot could have it save launch height measurements to help with practicing launch technique.</p>
 <h2>Usage</h2>The app menu is located under Applications. First time it is opened, it goes directly to the Settings screen, where you must select the sensor value to log, and the switch to trigger logging. You can also add it to a main screen as Displayed Telemetry.</p>
 <p>You can download the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI">SoarJETI GitHub repository.</a></p>
