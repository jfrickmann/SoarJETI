  <h1>Vibes</h1>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This app can produce haptic vibes in a similar way to Sounds on Events. I have made it for my DS-12, which only has an internal haptic unit. On radios with haptic gimbals, it will only vibrate the right stick.</p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
			<p>This app will be added to the bottom of the Advanced Properties Menu.</p>
			<p>You can download the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/jfrickmann/SoarJETI">SoarJETI GitHub repository.</a></p>
